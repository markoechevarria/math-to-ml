# Mathematics to Machine Learning

**Core Data Science Libraries**: Python implementations and examples utilizing libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**Mathematical Concepts**: Python-based implementations of the mathematical base of machine learning (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, and Probability).

**Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch**: Hand-coded implementations of Machine Learning algorithms built without high-level ML frameworks.
